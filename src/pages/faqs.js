            <p>● What are your hours and schedule?'
                <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ We have three options for families interested in joining our preschool. We have classes that meet twice a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, three times a week, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, five days a week, Mondays through Fridays. 
                <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ We have morning classes, 9 am-11 am, and afternoon classes 2 pm-4 pm. 
                <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ We also offer tutoring for children in grades K-5, by appointment.
                <br/>● How old do you have to be to be enrolled in Mec’s Munchkins?
                <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ We accept children ages 1-6 years for preschool classes and children in grades K-5th for tutoring sessions.
                <br/>● How are the children placed at Mec’s Munchkins?
                <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ Here at Mec’s Munchkins, we place our children based on their developmental level. Your child will be placed in the best class for them, rather than the age they are. We understand that each child is unique and just because they are a certain age, they may be at a different level. That is perfectly fine,  because we love and honor the uniqueness.
                <br/> ● Being an online preschool, how will my child stay focused and pay attention so they can learn?
                <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ We keep the children focused and engage through excitement; creating a welcoming and warming environment first and foremost. Here at Mec’s Munchkins, we encourage interactions and engagements with me as well as the other children in the class.
                <br/>● How will my child's privacy be maintained?
                <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ All classes are held through Zoom. The class will have its own ID number that only the families with children enrolled will have. This ID number will never be given to anyone else besides the families enrolled in that class. If your child will be using your Zoom account for class, we ask that you change the account name to your children’s name to ensure that all of the people that are supposed to be in the class are there and none of the people that are not.
                <br/> ● Do I have to be present during class time?
                <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ Parents do not have to be present during class time, but they are more than welcome to be! This would be a great experience for both the child and get the parents to experience together. I encourage parents to take the time to further educate their children by discussing what the child learned in class throughout the
day. This is something that can be a great bonding experience for both you and your child.
<br/>● What is Mec’s Munchkins curriculum?
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ The curriculum is literacy-based and was created with flexibility in mind. This means that there is a strong focus on getting your child ready for kindergarten. We work on academic readiness, phonological awareness, recessive and expressive identification of alphabets, shapes, colors, numbers, behavior maturity and so much more. The lessons are broken down to incorporate fun learning with small (but exciting) breaks because sitting down all class time would not be so fun.
<br/>● How will I be informed of my child’s progress?
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ There will be monthly progress meetings for the parents so they can stay up-to-date on how their child is progressing in preschool. If you would like to schedule a progress meeting other than this, please feel free to call, text, or email us and schedule one.
<br/>● Do I need to provide school supplies?
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ Following enrollment, you will be sent a Munchkin Kit with supplies that your child will need for the year. If your child runs out or needs to replace something, you can replace it or you can purchase another Munchkin Kit. 
<br/>● What happens if my child misses a class?
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ Life happens and sometimes we have to miss class;  that is okay! If your child happens to miss a class, have no fear! That’s what the on-demand videos are here!</p>
